# SwagBets
SwagBets is a platform for speculating on future events with market-based odds, otherwise known as a prediction market. Prediction markets serve as interesting demonstrations of market price discovery, and are often to said to outperform polls and pundits in predictive accuracy.

Tokens are traded on various outcomes, with prices serving to aggregate relevant knowledge and insights distributed among many traders with disparate information and experience, allowing the best possible predictions to emerge regarding uncertain future events.

SwagBets is written in Python/Django, using Bootstrap and Chart.js.

I am currently in the process of moving towards allowing events with any arbitrary number of outcomes. Currently, only events with a binary outcome (or which can be formulated as such) can be created.

SwagBets is available online at http://www.swagbets.net/

A very interesing economic paper on the power of prediction markets:

For unfortunate legal reasons, SwagBets will remain a platform for small friendly wagers among associates.
